# Data Science and Machine Learning Capstone Project

This repository contains the complete capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, focused on analyzing and predicting SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage landing success.

## Project Overview
The project follows an end-to-end data science workflow, including data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), interactive visualization, and machine learning modeling.

## Contents
- Jupyter notebooks for:
  - Data collection using the SpaceX REST API
  - Web scraping
  - Data wrangling and preprocessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with SQL and visualization
  - Interactive visual analytics with Folium
  - Machine learning classification models
- Cleaned and feature-engineered CSV datasets
- Interactive Plotly Dash application
- Final presentation slides (PDF)

## Repository Structure
- `*.ipynb` — Jupyter notebooks for each project stage  
- `*.csv` — Processed datasets used for analysis and modeling  
- `7_spacex-dash-app.py` — Plotly Dash dashboard source code  
- `*.pdf` — Final capstone presentation  

## Objective
To identify key factors affecting Falcon 9 first-stage landing success and evaluate multiple classification models to predict landing outcomes.
